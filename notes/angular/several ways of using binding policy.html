there are four kinds showed as blow, it need to be understood step by step
'adverb' is isolated scope value for its own and setted in link function
'who' is attr from html, when use '@' simbol, it refers to the value in html attributes with the same name if not nomited .
'flavor' is the property inherited from controller
'howTe' and 'how-te' is for nomited attribute and also testing camel casing

when comes to = binding, it is the same just replace the '@' simbol to '='

<script>
	
	var myModule = angular.module("MyModule", []);
	myModule.controller('MyCtrl', ['$scope', function($scope){
		$scope.ctrlFlavor="Sprite";

	}])
	myModule.directive("drink", function() {
		return {
			restrict:'AE',
			scope:{ 
				who:'@',// when comes to = binding, it is the same just replace the '@' simbol to '='
				flavor:'@',
				adj:'@howTe' // howTe refers to how-te in html file, it is camel casing, if use howTe in html it won't work.
				//,scope.adverb:'very much'  // wrong way to set isolated scope value
			},
			//scope.adverb:'very much',	// still wrong way to set isolated scope value
			template:"<div>{{who}} love {{adj}} {{flavor}} {{adverb}}</div> ", 
			link:function(scope,element,attrs){
				scope.adverb='very much'  //right way to set isolated scope value
			}
		}
	});
